<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a UI for an Interview Assistant application named AlphaView AI.

The initial request was to build a full-stack application. However, the user later clarified the requirement is to build a modern, beautiful, accessible, mobile-first **static front-end** for the Alpha View AI website. This static site should replace the current UI but keep the same client-side JS hooks (IDs/classes/data-attributes) so existing logic can be integrated later.

-   **Features to highlight:** Undetectable screen sharing, stealth mode, live transcription, AI-generated answers, coding support, and multi-language support.
-   **Tech Stack:** Static HTML, plain CSS (or SCSS), and minimal vanilla JS. No frameworks or heavy build tools.

None.

**Code Architecture**
The project is a simple static website with no backend. All files are located in the  directory.


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Static Site Generation:** The agent pivoted from the provided React/FastAPI stack to building a pure static website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
-   **Responsive Design:** CSS Flexbox and media queries are used to ensure the layout is mobile-first.
-   **Iterative UI/UX Design:** The agent has been refining the UI based on direct user feedback (e.g., make it look good, this is not good enough).

**key DB schema**
N/A (This is a static frontend project with no database).

**changes in tech stack**
The agent abandoned the initial React frontend and FastAPI backend in favor of creating a pure static site with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**All files of reference**
-   : The main landing page, which is currently being updated.
-   : The single stylesheet for the entire site. Needs to be updated for the new testimonials and platform sections.
-   : Contains JavaScript for UI interactions, like the FAQ accordion.
-   : The user dashboard page.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The  file is becoming large and monolithic. For better maintainability, it could be split into component-specific or page-specific stylesheets, although the user requested a minimal build process.

**key api endpoints**
N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   All work is being done in the  directory. Ignore the  and  directories from the original template.
-   The user is highly focused on visual design and aesthetics. Use the screenshot tool frequently to verify changes and ensure the output is modern and beautiful as per the user's taste.
-   The implementation is pure static HTML/CSS/JS. Do not introduce any frameworks or build tools unless explicitly requested.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
